# Brief notes

* Holographic crystal storage‽ And rewriteable! And self-supervised learning can help you learn the particular manufacturing artifacts of a camera and a crystal‽
* ML can help target radiotherapy beams, taking a 73 minute process and turning it into 5 minutes
* software that is learned from data is the AI revolution (much like Karpathy's [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35))
* Federated Learning can be backdoored ("Attack of the tails")
  * I'm unsure about the trust model for the interaction: I trust a company to run arbitrary programs on my device, and send arbitrary ML models to a server, but not the raw data? We've been able to extract patterns in raw data from ML models, so,
  * Even still, that you can misclassify a Southwest Airlines plane as a truck is Not Good
* Big self-supervised models are strong self-supervised learners
  * distillation and self-supervision are popular and useful, and SimCLR(v2) sounds promising
* Unsupervised translation between programming languages
  * with monolingual code!
* Saiph Savage: A Future of work for the invisible workers in AI
  * 60% of US workers involved in invisible labor (MTurking etc, below the API) in five years?!?!?!?!?!
  * web plugins can repurpose labor platforms for good
  * twitter bots trying different messaging found direct CTAs the most "effective"
* JAX MD for molecular dynamics
* Worst-Case Analysis for Randomly Collected Data tries to correct for snowball sampling, much more effective than oversampling
