# Brief notes

* These days are very long! Starting at 5am PST, continuing through the evening
* Control theory (like for controlling airplanes), but for exploring gradients! Handling second-order issues like momentum
* [Anna Hoffman](https://www.annaeveryday.com/): Something beautiful had been ruined forever
  * AI ethics often starts from an abstract idealized world view, instead of being grounded in the world as it is today
    * I see that people are asking ["Should GPT-3 have the right to free speech?"](https://coling2020.org/pages/programme)), while [GPT-3 advocates for phrenology and acts as a collaborator in human rights violations](/2020/10/02/gpt-3-unlearning.html)
  * (the ruined beauty was the innocence about the goodness of the world)
  * conceiving of AI as forever growing and always bettering can ignore that problems along the way are related and a direct product of AI itself
    * how many more [problems with facial recognition](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coded_bias) and [predict if a face is gay](https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/05/ai_gaydar/) or [predict if a face is a criminal](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28)
  * attempts to make algorithms more fair can use a reflection of existing social structures (two genders, for instance, which is fewer than the California DMV)
  * tough to prevent future gaydar facial recognition studies, in the real world: more effective to focus on current oppression
  * bioethics has interesting parallels, but it is also very much a product of historical discourse, and AI is much newer
* What are we going to do about Computer Vision?, a panel in Queer in AI
  * Critical work is necessary! And critical work does not need to end on a note of resolution ðŸ˜…
  * Participation isn't enough: everyone on all sides can intertwine with oppressive systems
  * [Sometimes the best participation is refusal!](https://afog.berkeley.edu/programs/the-refusal-conference)
    * The Luddites were skilled machinists who were told that they were getting fired and replaced by machines, so they smashed the machines
* Low-data low-compute is always alluring, obvi
* StyleGAN with data augmentation has good results on only a thousand images! Especially after finetuning from FFHQ! Collecting 70k faces is challening, but 1k faces is few enough to come from an art museum
* To read: [The Eureka Effect: The Art and Logic of Breakthrough Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Effect-Logic-Breakthrough-Thinking/dp/0393322556)
* To explore: [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/)
* Frightening: [identifying personal genomes by surname inference](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321)
