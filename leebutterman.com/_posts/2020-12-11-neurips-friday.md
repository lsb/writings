# Brief notes

* Resistance AI!
  * (né Radical AI, but "radical" is stative, whereas "resistance" is active)
  * rather than talking about a Level 12 SVP's feelings, we should be building a cross-class labor movement between data sources, and content moderators and researchers and more
  * "What is AI for me? A tool in the hands of very powerful people that is increasingly consolidating power" —Dr Timnit Gebru
  * we need to dismantle some parts of the field: predictive policing should not be built
  * is AI development trapped in a paradigm of efficiency?
  * Oral tradition as compression algorithm:
    * the hawaiian calendar is a guide for what to fish and plant and when
    * cf hesiod, and oral-formulaic poetry as channel for PIE formulae 
  * 30% of all languages spoken today are African, lots of excuses for no papers in many different languages, but there are arising new benchmarks for native speakers, and there are no major voice assistants for people who don't speak EN/FR/&c
  * [Data for Black Lives](https://d4bl.org/):
    * Data as protest, data as accountability, data as collective action
  * Our Data Bodies: how do we build power and sustain momentum, how does one push at the status quo?

* Posters!
  * _yours truly_ : [GPT-3 can be induced to collaborate in human rights violations](/assets/leebutterman-gpt-3-gedi-lordegalt-poster.png), but GeDi can swerve generation towards one of two very different authors, like Audre Lord vs Ayn Rand
  * [Data strikes](https://blog.datadividendproject.com/data-strikes/): withholding use/production of data from AI (say, recommendation systems) as labor organizing
  * [Social Bias Frames](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03891.pdf): social bias inference corpus, tracking social dynamics and multi-dimensional problematic language
  * [Against Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08850.pdf): instead of high modernism organizing the world's information and making it useful, build relationships with the neighborhood and build tools to organize people to interact with neighbors
