## Continuing on atrocious beginnings to novels

## Little Lytton

The annual Bulwer‐Lytton Fiction Contest challenges entrants to pen the world’s most atrocious first line to a novel.  Winners (and runners‐up and honorable mentions) are generally very long. The
inspiration for the contest is the opening sentence of [Edward Bulwer-Lytton]()'s novel Paul Clifford:

> It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Brevity is the soul of wit, and this goes on and on and on. [Adam Cadre's Lyttle Lytton Contest](http://adamcadre.ac/lyttle.html) proposes an alternative, inspired by an alternative:

> Jennifer stood there, quietly ovulating.

"The non‐action of “stood”, the vagueness of “there”, the involuntary process of ovulation treated as an activity,
the inappropriateness of measuring the volume of that non‐activity, the uncomfortably gynecological detail of mentioning it at all—​all combine to make a cringeworthy sentence.
And since it’s only five words long, its impact is instant; you don’t have readers slogging through clause after clause after clause."

I decided to use the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) large model, in the [🤗 Write With Transformer interactive environment](https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large), and extrapolate the first paragraphs from each of these atrocious sentences.

> Jenny stood there, quietly ovulating.
> *She had her arms spread out in front of her.*
> * "And I would like it if your first child would be a*
> *girl," Jenny told the crowd, her eyes wide and
> * her cheeks still flushed.*

We see her in a beatific pose with arms embracing her audience,
we encounter her _in medias res_ as she is preaching to an audience (of expectant first-time parents?),
we observe the conflict between the non-action of stood and the vagueness of there with the rush of blood to her cheeks and the dilation of her pupils,
we note the delicacy of the subjunctive mood and the inappropriate bluntness and personal nature of the wish.

This takes the punchy confusion and overpersonal cringe of the initial five-word sentence, and expands in many dimensions.
The first sentence provokes an unease as to where to the story is going, and the exposition amplifies all of those emotions as it continues.
