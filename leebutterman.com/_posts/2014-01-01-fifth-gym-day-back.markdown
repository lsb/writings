   > 5th gym day back. How does adult life not come with participation trophies? I could really go for some false recognition right about now.

It turns out that <a href="https://github.com/lsb/turk-rest-api">turk-rest-api</a> makes that really easy.

I collected some results of twenty random strangers from the internet who wanted to be paid ten cents to write literally anything; the description of the task was _"Life counseling, one text box at a time."_ and the question was _"This is my fifth day back at the gym. Please respond."_ and everyone who submitted an answer was accepted.

  * I started to get lose my weight.
  * Keep it up, the hardest part is getting to the gym, once you are there its cake!
  * enjoy!!
  * Congratulations on keeping with your fitness regimen so far! Not to stymie your efforts but make sure you are resting sufficiently between sessions to get the maximal benefit of your efforts. Perhaps you could try consulting with a trainer to see if there are any adjustments you can make to your routine to help make sure that you are properly approaching your work outs.
