Thanks for reading.

I've also made:

[NoDictionaries](https://nodictionaries.com/vergil/aeneid-1/1-7): a reading environment for Latin with adjustable interlinear vocabulary, that can also make word lists based on just the words you don't know. (Ruby+Javascript, ~5kLoC). Master's project at Tufts.

[PoetaExMachina](https://poetaexmachina.net): Text to speech for Latin poetry. Phoneme to speech using MBROLA. (Awk+Ruby, ~1kLoC). Bachelor's Thesis at Brown.

[Passphrase-Safety](/passphrase-safety): interactive visualization of the entropy of a passphrase, using Golomb-compressed sequences for probabilistic set membership purely client side.
